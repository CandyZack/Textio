# Textio

_Video is to photo, Textio is to text_

This app has a recorder to record the typing as you do, and generates a file in .tio extension.
Also, it has a player that can play any .tio extension file and plays the typing character by character with the recorded time duration between them.

## Installation

For Player

```bash
python player/main.py sampleFile.tio
```

For Recorder

```bash
python recorder/main.py
```

## Motivation

I was frustrated when I see any tutorial video on YouTube and can't read the text in the programming tutorials, and then I have to switch to HD. But, if I have bad internet then I am \*\*\*\*ed. People can send a "text video"-Textio files to their friends or students instead.

I am still working on this, will make a proper software. Maybe adding a Audio would really cool.

Contributions are welcomed.
